[0.00s -> 3.46s] SPEAKER_00: What have you come to learn about people pleasing people pleases where it comes from?
[4.24s -> 9.58s] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so, you know, often, often it makes sense that, you know, often these things feel
[10.56s -> 15.02s] SPEAKER_01: confusing until you hear someone's story and then it makes complete sense. And you kind of,
[15.02s -> 20.82s] SPEAKER_01: I've had so many of these moments with people in the room where, you know, they come in and think
[21.64s -> 26.60s] SPEAKER_01: you're just not going to understand this. This is just bizarre and complex and I don't get it. And
[26.60s -> 32.36s] SPEAKER_01: and then you spend a decent amount of time going through someone's story. And then you get to this
[32.94s -> 38.74s] SPEAKER_01: lovely point where you kind of say to each other, of course, of course it is this way,
[38.88s -> 44.68s] SPEAKER_01: how could it not be given everything that's happened? And, you know, there isn't sort of one
[44.68s -> 50.90s] SPEAKER_01: story or one scenario that always leads to people pleasing. There are lots of different ones. And
[50.90s -> 56.26s] SPEAKER_01: but I think it's important to distinguish that people pleasing isn't being a nice person.
[57.34s -> 65.28s] SPEAKER_01: It's so much more than that. It's being absolutely vigilant to how other people feel
[65.28s -> 71.94s] SPEAKER_01: and placing that as your absolute priority over and above your own well-being, your own health,
[72.18s -> 77.84s] SPEAKER_01: anything. So, you know, it's just terrifying the thought of displeasing someone else or
[78.48s -> 82.14s] SPEAKER_01: experiencing their disapproval or they're not liking you or rejecting you.
[83.30s -> 93.12s] SPEAKER_01: And so, you know, I've seen people who live in turmoil trying to please everybody around them
[93.12s -> 101.38s] SPEAKER_01: and keep them pleased, which is not sustainable. And so it creates chaos where, you know, you're
[101.38s -> 106.40s] SPEAKER_01: constantly chasing your tail and and it gives other people a lot of power over you. So you can
[106.40s -> 115.14s] SPEAKER_01: end up in in relationships that are sort of exploitative or just not healthy for you. And
[116.08s -> 122.56s] SPEAKER_01: yeah, so I think it's one of those things that sort of banded around. And it's something that
[122.56s -> 127.60s] SPEAKER_01: a lot of us kind of do in bits and bobs, kind of like, yeah, sometimes I'm like that or in
[127.60s -> 133.52s] SPEAKER_01: certain situations, I'm like that. And some people spend their lives really, really struggling with
[133.52s -> 137.90s] SPEAKER_00: that. The desire for us to take something we do a little bit and turn it into a label that
[137.90s -> 144.68s] SPEAKER_00: describes our entire personality is quite strong, even the pathologization of sort of normal emotions
[144.68s -> 150.40s] SPEAKER_00: in that way, which is odd, right? Because both of me and you are fans of sort of emotionally
[150.40s -> 154.96s] SPEAKER_00: informed therapy and people understanding their emotions. I also think it's very interesting.
[155.18s -> 159.40s] SPEAKER_00: I think it's one of the most interesting things that you can do. And yet, I imagine that you have
[159.40s -> 165.80s] SPEAKER_00: a similar problem to me as the overuse of therapy speak online to describe like, this person wasn't
[165.80s -> 171.98s] SPEAKER_00: mean to me, they were narcissistic or they caused me trauma. You know, I'm not sad, I'm depressed.
[172.46s -> 177.24s] SPEAKER_00: And the sort of the straying over into you crossed a boundary, that's one of my bound,
[177.54s -> 183.56s] SPEAKER_00: etc, etc. So people, a lot of the time, will say yes to things when they mean to say no,
[183.60s -> 186.96s] SPEAKER_00: or they want to say no, they want to become firmer at being able to disappoint those around them.
[186.96s -> 191.50s] SPEAKER_01: How can they become better at that? I think it's one of the most important skills
[191.50s -> 196.88s] SPEAKER_01: anyone will ever learn, actually, because you put yourself at risk if you can't
[198.36s -> 203.44s] SPEAKER_01: say no when you need to, or you can't hold boundaries. And there's that people pleasing
[203.44s -> 216.94s] SPEAKER_01: tendency. So if everything is about everybody else and what they want from you. And that's
[216.94s -> 223.86s] SPEAKER_01: and wishes and desires come first. And you don't have the ability to put a stop to that when it
[223.86s -> 228.54s] SPEAKER_01: doesn't fit. Then you'll end up doing things that you regret and don't fit with your values,
[228.54s -> 231.88s] SPEAKER_01: or that don't feel like you're being a nice person, but it's because somebody else
[231.88s -> 240.14s] SPEAKER_01: has more power over your behavior than you do. So I think assertiveness skills are a big part
[240.14s -> 246.54s] SPEAKER_01: of what's taught in therapy, actually, you know, teaching people to manage difficult people and
[246.94s -> 253.04s] SPEAKER_01: people who perhaps have more power in relationship or, you know, it kind of sounds easy to be able
[253.04s -> 259.64s] SPEAKER_01: to say no. And it's not because it's always packed out with lots of emotion and complex
[259.64s -> 265.26s] SPEAKER_01: dynamics between two people. And so it can be really difficult. But it's absolutely learnable.
[265.44s -> 272.02s] SPEAKER_01: And so that's where it's important to remember that even if you've had a habit for life of
[272.02s -> 276.78s] SPEAKER_01: putting everybody else first and being the, I don't mind, I'm fine, you know, whatever you think,
[276.94s -> 284.02s] SPEAKER_01: type person, that you can begin to change. But it's often about learning specific skills.
[284.44s -> 290.28s] SPEAKER_01: And why do you start? What are the skills? So a lot of it is practice in
[291.58s -> 295.98s] SPEAKER_01: lighthearted ways. You know, we talked about the sort of acting opposite to urges, using polos,
[296.26s -> 301.82s] SPEAKER_01: and kind of, you know, situations that aren't necessarily the most emotive, the most difficult
[301.82s -> 309.00s] SPEAKER_01: for you. You kind of grade situations, you could even make a list to be fair. So you can make
[309.00s -> 312.54s] SPEAKER_01: lists of the different situations where it's difficult to be assertive or state your own needs.
[312.96s -> 318.02s] SPEAKER_01: And you take the easiest one. And you start with that. And you practice, and you have a go,
[318.20s -> 323.96s] SPEAKER_01: and then you come back and you see how it went, what went well, what would, you know, and so I was
[323.96s -> 331.44s] SPEAKER_01: working with someone on dealing with those kind of asserted skills or needing to state your ownies
[331.44s -> 338.02s] SPEAKER_01: in a workplace and, you know, going home on time or taking holiday, those sorts of things.
[338.34s -> 343.74s] SPEAKER_01: And so we started with something really that felt the easiest. And then we just assessed it. So,
[343.82s -> 349.54s] SPEAKER_01: you know, stress test things and then learn from it. Actually, the anticipated anxiety about it was
[349.54s -> 354.66s] SPEAKER_01: much worse than actually the awkward moment of saying what I needed to say. And their reaction
[354.66s -> 360.86s] SPEAKER_01: was not as bad as I thought it would be. You know, I had all that fear and discomfort, but that died
[360.86s -> 366.12s] SPEAKER_01: down as soon as the moment was over. And then actually, I got what I needed and the situation
[366.12s -> 371.24s] SPEAKER_01: was better than it would have been. And I'm not living in resentment. So when you start small,
[371.62s -> 376.34s] SPEAKER_01: you get these small victories that give you that momentum and give you that sort of
[376.34s -> 380.80s] SPEAKER_01: drive to move forward and go for the next challenge. But you can't expect to suddenly go,
[380.92s -> 387.10s] SPEAKER_01: right, from now on, I'm going to be boundaries and assertive and strong and
[387.68s -> 389.08s] SPEAKER_00: be going overnight hard.
[389.78s -> 394.14s] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, right. It's just not going to happen. You have to do these things gradually and start with
[394.14s -> 398.74s] SPEAKER_01: the easiest thing, something that almost feels a bit silly, that's so easy. It's almost a bit
[398.74s -> 403.00s] SPEAKER_01: kind of really, am I starting here? But then you get that little easy victory and then you move on
[403.00s -> 405.82s] SPEAKER_01: to the next one, which is a little bit more difficult and so on.
[406.12s -> 412.18s] SPEAKER_00: That anticipatory anxiety thing is so funny, because you're right, it's almost always your
[412.18s -> 417.86s] SPEAKER_00: ability to turn the future situation into a nightmare is significantly better than it almost
[417.86s -> 422.74s] SPEAKER_00: ever is. And the stupid thing is that all of the nightmares that you genuinely encounter in the
[422.74s -> 426.22s] SPEAKER_00: real world are ones that you probably didn't see coming. So you go, okay, so I have this unbelievable
[426.22s -> 429.86s] SPEAKER_00: ability to predict things that aren't problems and not predict things that are going to be massive
[429.86s -> 436.40s] SPEAKER_00: issues. Okay, brilliant. Thanks. Amazing way that our brains are set up. But yeah, I think that
[436.40s -> 443.98s] SPEAKER_00: that's right. And again, as a slowly rehabilitating people pleaser, that's a way that I found to be
[443.98s -> 451.00s] SPEAKER_00: better as well, to learn to be able to make demands of other people, to not subjugate my needs,
[451.44s -> 454.82s] SPEAKER_00: or believe that I don't have needs, or think that it's noble to not have needs,
[455.14s -> 459.46s] SPEAKER_00: to put somebody else ahead of me. Oh, this is like a sort of a sacrificial type. It's a sort of odd
[459.46s -> 465.44s] SPEAKER_00: like emotional puritanism, where you think, if I feel bad, but someone else feels good,
[465.92s -> 472.28s] SPEAKER_00: net net, that means that it's good. You go, what if both, what if you could both feel good,
[472.28s -> 477.26s] SPEAKER_00: but you just need to sort of make a demand? Yeah. Yeah, so true. And often you're,
[477.44s -> 481.22s] SPEAKER_01: when you feel like you're being a nice person, because you're making them feel good.
[482.58s -> 487.00s] SPEAKER_01: Actually, sometimes what you're doing is just appeasing them. And you're just scared of their
[487.00s -> 492.58s] SPEAKER_01: emotional reaction or their disapproval. And it's, you know, feel it's motivated by fear of
[492.58s -> 499.30s] SPEAKER_01: what their reaction might be, rather than, you know, your own values around what should happen
[499.30s -> 503.00s] SPEAKER_00: in that situation. It's also not very trustworthy. If somebody can't trust you, I know it's very
[503.00s -> 508.12s] SPEAKER_00: difficult to trust your yes. And, you know, you hinted at, if you don't have any choice,
[508.22s -> 511.16s] SPEAKER_00: it's not particularly virtuous, you don't even feel good about doing the virtuous thing,
[511.22s -> 515.66s] SPEAKER_00: because you didn't have any other option. You didn't choose to be nice to this person,
[515.66s -> 521.90s] SPEAKER_00: you simply couldn't be bad. And I had, I wrote about this this week, actually, that a friend of mine,
[521.94s -> 527.52s] SPEAKER_00: a few months ago, me and him, it had a sort of well-meaning debate, but I was worried that I'd
[527.52s -> 531.90s] SPEAKER_00: upset him. So I rang him a little bit afterwards. And I was like, hey, man, I just wanted to sort of
[532.18s -> 534.72s] SPEAKER_00: check in and make sure that you're all right. I said, yeah, of course, like, of course it was,
[534.80s -> 539.42s] SPEAKER_00: it was totally fine. And then he heard me start to chastise myself for going, see, this is,
[539.44s -> 542.92s] SPEAKER_00: this is my people pleasing nature coming out. This is me. I had to check in, he's like, whoa,
[542.92s -> 546.88s] SPEAKER_00: well, hang on a second. The reason that I love you as a friend, for one of the big reasons,
[546.90s -> 551.10s] SPEAKER_00: is because you decided to put me first, even in this situation, even the one that was neutral,
[551.20s -> 555.26s] SPEAKER_00: the fact that you did reach out and carry, is like, be careful pathologising something
[555.68s -> 560.36s] SPEAKER_00: which is actually a really virtuous part of who you are. And I'm like, right, okay. So
[561.34s -> 568.42s] SPEAKER_00: doing the thing was good. It's a part of my nature that my friends are glad that I have.
[568.42s -> 574.32s] SPEAKER_00: Yeah. But by not really, by being compelled to do it as opposed to choosing to do it,
[574.34s -> 577.66s] SPEAKER_00: that does kind of derogate some of the virtue that's behind it. So I was like, right, okay,
[577.70s -> 582.48s] SPEAKER_00: so am I supposed to purposefully try and get rid of that? So briefly make myself a worse friend,
[582.74s -> 586.90s] SPEAKER_00: to then relearn it again consciously so that I can finally get back to the place that I was in
[586.90s -> 590.10s] SPEAKER_00: the beginning. Like that seems unnecessarily effortful. Like to go around this whole loop,
[590.12s -> 593.24s] SPEAKER_00: to end up at the place that I started again. But this time it's, you know what I mean?
[593.24s -> 599.62s] SPEAKER_00: And I think this line between virtue from compulsions and virtue from choices,
[599.98s -> 604.62s] SPEAKER_00: and then this odd sense that we need to deprogram, is that right? Okay, so if it's hard to do,
[604.68s -> 609.08s] SPEAKER_00: does that make it more virtuous? Like, it's in my nature. Like that's just me speaking forward.
[609.22s -> 613.34s] SPEAKER_00: What a lovely way to be. Would you rather be somebody that's mean, and you have to work hard
[613.34s -> 617.16s] SPEAKER_00: to do that thing? Would that make you a better person? If you were good, but you was naturally
[617.16s -> 621.90s] SPEAKER_00: mean? I'm sure I'd be able to find a way to castigate myself and whip myself into submission.
[621.90s -> 625.26s] SPEAKER_00: Well, I mean, you know that you did the thing, but you didn't feel like doing the things that,
[625.42s -> 632.90s] SPEAKER_00: the human desire to minimise our sort of good points is robust, to say the least.
[633.06s -> 639.12s] SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and like you say, it's all about the choice. And that you clearly have an awareness of it now.
[639.32s -> 644.02s] SPEAKER_01: And so if you found yourself in a situation where it was really detrimental to you,
[644.06s -> 648.06s] SPEAKER_01: and you knew that you probably should say something different, but you'd said X because
[648.06s -> 655.10s] SPEAKER_01: because of that pure pleasing tendency, then you'd be in a better position to be able to
[655.10s -> 659.18s] SPEAKER_01: choose something different because you have that awareness. And that's the key, isn't it?
[659.40s -> 666.70s] SPEAKER_01: Is it's okay to have that as a trait and that sort of tendency? Because if you're aware of it,
[666.72s -> 672.10s] SPEAKER_01: then when it becomes troublesome, you stand a chance at doing something different. It doesn't
[672.10s -> 676.24s] SPEAKER_01: mean you have to kind of eradicate everything and, you know, clean slate and start again.
[676.84s -> 681.72s] SPEAKER_01: You can, and that's the thing, you know, a lot of, a lot of stuff now is about,
[681.80s -> 687.02s] SPEAKER_01: like you say, pathologising everything and, and as if it's something that's wrong with us. And,
[687.22s -> 692.86s] SPEAKER_01: and actually those, those tendencies can also be really lovable parts of us and things that
[692.86s -> 696.74s] SPEAKER_01: other people appreciate about us, that we appreciate about ourselves,
[697.38s -> 699.28s] SPEAKER_01: but that don't always work in every context.
[699.76s -> 703.84s] SPEAKER_00: Trust really is everything when it comes to supplements. A lot of brands may say the top
[703.84s -> 708.72s] SPEAKER_00: quality, but few can actually prove it, which is why I partnered with Momentus. They make the
[708.72s -> 713.24s] SPEAKER_00: highest quality supplements on the planet. Three of the products that I use to support my brain,
[713.38s -> 717.94s] SPEAKER_00: body and sleep every day are Omega threes, creatine and magnesium l3 and 8. Honestly,
[718.04s -> 721.62s] SPEAKER_00: I try and limit the number of supplements that I rely on. But when I take these consistently,
[721.70s -> 726.82s] SPEAKER_00: they have a massive impact on my cognitive performance, my strength and my sleep. Momentus
[726.82s -> 730.96s] SPEAKER_00: are literally unparalleled when it comes to rigorous third party testing. What you read on
[730.96s -> 734.90s] SPEAKER_00: the label is what's in the product and absolutely nothing else. Best of all,
[735.08s -> 739.54s] SPEAKER_00: they have a 30 day money back guarantee. So you can buy it and try it for 29 days. And if you do
