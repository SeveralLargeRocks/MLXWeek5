modern_wisdom_dr_julie_smith_segment_1.wav,"What have you come to learn about people pleasing people pleases where it comes from?<|startoflm|> Yeah, so, you know, often, often it makes sense that, you know, often these things feel confusing until you hear someone's story and then it makes complete sense. And you kind of, I've had so many of these moments with people in the room where, you know, they come in and think you're just not going to understand this. This is just bizarre and complex and I don't get it. And and then you spend a decent amount of time going through someone's"
modern_wisdom_dr_julie_smith_segment_10.wav,"a habit for life of putting everybody else first and being the, I don't mind, I'm fine, you know, whatever you think, type person, that you can begin to change. But it's often about learning specific skills. And why do you start? What are the skills? So a lot of it is practice in lighthearted ways. You know, we talked about the sort of acting opposite to urges, using polos, and kind of, you know, situations that aren't necessarily the most"
modern_wisdom_dr_julie_smith_segment_11.wav,"emotive, the most difficult for you. You kind of grade situations, you could even make a list to be fair. So you can make lists of the different situations where it's difficult to be assertive or state your own needs. And you take the easiest one. And you start with that. And you practice, and you have a go, and then you come back and you see how it went, what went well, what would, you know, and so I was working with someone on dealing with those kind of asserted skills or needing to"
modern_wisdom_dr_julie_smith_segment_12.wav,"state your ownies in a workplace and, you know, going home on time or taking holiday, those sorts of things. And so we started with something really that felt the easiest. And then we just assessed it. So, you know, stress test things and then learn from it. Actually, the anticipated anxiety about it was much worse than actually the awkward moment of saying what I needed to say. And their reaction was not as bad as I thought it would be. You know, I had all that fear and discomfort,"
modern_wisdom_dr_julie_smith_segment_13.wav,"but that died down as soon as the moment was over. And then actually, I got what I needed and the situation was better than it would have been. And I'm not living in resentment. So when you start small, you get these small victories that give you that momentum and give you that sort of drive to move forward and go for the next challenge. But you can't expect to suddenly go, right, from now on, I'm going to be boundaries and assertive and strong and<|startoflm|> be going overnight hard.<|startoflm|> Yeah,"
modern_wisdom_dr_julie_smith_segment_14.wav,"right. It's just not going to happen. You have to do these things gradually and start with the easiest thing, something that almost feels a bit silly, that's so easy. It's almost a bit kind of really, am I starting here? But then you get that little easy victory and then you move on to the next one, which is a little bit more difficult and so on.<|startoflm|> That anticipatory anxiety thing is so funny, because you're right, it's almost always your ability to turn the future situation into a nightmare is significantly better than it almost ever is. And the stupid thing is that"
modern_wisdom_dr_julie_smith_segment_15.wav,"all of the nightmares that you genuinely encounter in the real world are ones that you probably didn't see coming. So you go, okay, so I have this unbelievable ability to predict things that aren't problems and not predict things that are going to be massive issues. Okay, brilliant. Thanks. Amazing way that our brains are set up. But yeah, I think that that's right. And again, as a slowly rehabilitating people pleaser, that's a way that I found to be better as well, to learn to be able to make demands of other people, to not subjugate"
modern_wisdom_dr_julie_smith_segment_16.wav,"my needs, or believe that I don't have needs, or think that it's noble to not have needs, to put somebody else ahead of me. Oh, this is like a sort of a sacrificial type. It's a sort of odd like emotional puritanism, where you think, if I feel bad, but someone else feels good, net net, that means that it's good. You go, what if both, what if you could both feel good, but you just need to sort of make a demand? Yeah. Yeah, so true. And often you're,<|startoflm|> when you feel like you're being a nice person, because you're"
modern_wisdom_dr_julie_smith_segment_17.wav,"making them feel good. Actually, sometimes what you're doing is just appeasing them. And you're just scared of their emotional reaction or their disapproval. And it's, you know, feel it's motivated by fear of what their reaction might be, rather than, you know, your own values around what should happen<|startoflm|> in that situation. It's also not very trustworthy. If somebody can't trust you, I know it's very difficult to trust your yes. And, you know, you hinted at, if you don't have any choice, it's not particularly virtuous, you don't even feel good"
modern_wisdom_dr_julie_smith_segment_18.wav,"about doing the virtuous thing, because you didn't have any other option. You didn't choose to be nice to this person, you simply couldn't be bad. And I had, I wrote about this this week, actually, that a friend of mine, a few months ago, me and him, it had a sort of well-meaning debate, but I was worried that I'd upset him. So I rang him a little bit afterwards. And I was like, hey, man, I just wanted to sort of check in and make sure that you're all right. I said, yeah, of course, like, of course it was, it was totally fine. And then he heard me start to chastise myself for going, see, this is, this is my people"

The reason that I love you as a friend, for one of the big reasons, is because you decided to put me first, even in this situation, even the one that was neutral, the fact that you did reach out and carry, is like, be careful pathologising something which is actually a really virtuous part of who you are. And I'm like, right, okay. So doing the thing was good. It's a part of my nature that my friends are glad that I have. Yeah. But by not really,"
modern_wisdom_dr_julie_smith_segment_2.wav,"story. And then you get to this lovely point where you kind of say to each other, of course, of course it is this way, how could it not be given everything that's happened? And, you know, there isn't sort of one story or one scenario that always leads to people pleasing. There are lots of different ones. And but I think it's important to distinguish that people pleasing isn't being a nice person. It's so much more than that."
modern_wisdom_dr_julie_smith_segment_20.wav,"by being compelled to do it as opposed to choosing to do it, that does kind of derogate some of the virtue that's behind it. So I was like, right, okay, so am I supposed to purposefully try and get rid of that? So briefly make myself a worse friend, to then relearn it again consciously so that I can finally get back to the place that I was in the beginning. Like that seems unnecessarily effortful. Like to go around this whole loop, to end up at the place that I started again. But this time it's, you know what I mean? And I think this line between virtue from compulsions and virtue from choices, and"
modern_wisdom_dr_julie_smith_segment_21.wav,"then this odd sense that we need to deprogram, is that right? Okay, so if it's hard to do, does that make it more virtuous? Like, it's in my nature. Like that's just me speaking forward. What a lovely way to be. Would you rather be somebody that's mean, and you have to work hard to do that thing? Would that make you a better person? If you were good, but you was naturally mean? I'm sure I'd be able to find a way to castigate myself and whip myself into submission. Well, I mean, you know that you did the thing, but you didn't feel like doing the things that, the human desire to minimise our sort of good points"
modern_wisdom_dr_julie_smith_segment_22.wav,"is robust, to say the least.<|startoflm|> Yeah, and like you say, it's all about the choice. And that you clearly have an awareness of it now. And so if you found yourself in a situation where it was really detrimental to you, and you knew that you probably should say something different, but you'd said X because because of that pure pleasing tendency, then you'd be in a better position to be able to choose something different because you have that awareness. And that's the key, isn't it? Is it's"
modern_wisdom_dr_julie_smith_segment_23.wav,"okay to have that as a trait and that sort of tendency? Because if you're aware of it, then when it becomes troublesome, you stand a chance at doing something different. It doesn't mean you have to kind of eradicate everything and, you know, clean slate and start again. You can, and that's the thing, you know, a lot of, a lot of stuff now is about, like you say, pathologising everything and, and as if it's something that's wrong with us.
